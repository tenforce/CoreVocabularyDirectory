#+TITLE: Core Vocabulary Directory

* Introduction
Original code was taken from [mdr/github].
* Installation
The assumption is that a linux system is being used for development
and eventual deployment.

* Development
** Docker Usage

** Network Configuration
For local development the dockerfile can be used to mimic the eventual
system. This requires a local system override of the
vocabs.tenforce.com machine (/etc/hosts)

127.0.0.1             vocabs.tenforce.com
* Deployment & Testing
- Note :: First test using the Docker image

This consists of several actions
- Tar the mdr directory (*tar cvzf mdr.tgz mdr*)
- Copy the mdr.tgz file to the remote system
Then on the remote sustem
- switch off apache2 and tomcat7 services (virtuoso will be on port 80)
  - Note :: Other configuration will be needed if those services are needed.
- Unpack the mdr.tgz file in the /var/lib/virtuoso-opensource-6.1/vsp directory
- Update the virtuoso.ini file,
- execute the vhost_*.sql file using isql-vt
- then using the virtuoso conductor, upload the datafiles into the
  http://vocabs.tenforce.com/webDAV graph.
Restart the virtuoso-opensource service.
